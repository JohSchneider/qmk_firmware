## update AUDIO-feature comment in rules.mk

* audio_avr.c does not default to any pin, there has to be a #define XX_AUDIO in config.h at some level, for it to actually work

these changes on way to many files do exactly one thing, replacing strings in rules.mk
from

-AUDIO_ENABLE = yes          # Audio output on port C6
to
+AUDIO_ENABLE = yes          # Audio output (needs a pin configured in config.h, see docs/feature_audio.md)     


while preserving the yes/no selection, and leaving keyboards that have already something other then the default comment 'Audio output on port C6'
