## fixing wrong configuration of AUDIO feature

* audio_avr.c does not default to any pin, there has to be a #define XX_AUDIO in config.h at some level, for it to actually work
  otherwise the audio-code ends up cluttering the firmware, possibly breaking builds because the maximum allowed firmware size is exceeded

=> these changes whant to fix this by disabling audio on keyboards that have audio misconfigured=non-functional
